1. How to Start a Speech by Conor Neill
```

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w82a1FT5o88)

- start with a question that matters to the audience (number 3)
- factoid that shocks. (number 2) Examples:  

   "There are more people alive today that have ever died"   
   
   "Every two minutes the energy reaching the Earth from the Sun 
     is equivalant of the whole annual usage of humanity"
   
- how you start a story to a child? "Once upon a time...". Do the equivalant for adults. Make a story about people. Make it personal.
