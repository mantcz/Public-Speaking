1. How to Start a Speech by Conor Neill
```

[Link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w82a1FT5o88)

- start with a question that matters to the audience (number 3)
- factoid that shocks. (number 2) Examples:  

   "There are more people alive today that have ever died"   
   
   "Every two minutes the energy reaching the Earth from the Sun 
     is equivalant of the whole annual usage of humanity"
   
- how you start a story to a child? "Once upon a time...". Do the equivalant for adults. Make a story about people. Make it personal.

3. The 3 Aspects of a Great Conference Talk by Rob Walling
```

My mental model of a talk has 3 aspects that should work in tandem:

#### Content
The key with content is to know your audience and their expectations.
#### Delivery
Delivery is about stage presence. Energy. Confidence.

You know it when you see it – some people have great stage presence, other people (like me in 2008) seem nervous and meek. Over-caffeinated and stressed.

This one takes a lot of repetition to overcome (for those who don’t have it naturally), whether on your own or with a speaking coach.

#### Entertainment
Difficult to make it right.
